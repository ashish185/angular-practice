1. What is the difference between tsconfig.json vs tsconfig.app.json?
- Ans: 
 - **tsconfig.json**: common settings
  
  - **tsconfig.app.json**:  It inherits the above tsconfig.json file and specific folder settings can be applied here. 
    - File inclusion/exclusion patterns for the app build
    - Different target settings for production builds
    - Excludes test files from the application bundle
